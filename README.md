# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The purpose of the project was to make a simple analysis tool that can take a large list of produce and condense it down into a readable data printout for the end user. The program had three forms of print outs; a frequency table, the frequency of a single item, and a histogram.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a good job at keeping my Python functions modular should extra functionality need to be added in the future.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think that I still need practice with exception handling as I have minimal experience and I believe it shows. Looking back, I believe that a variable or two could have been named better to improve readability.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? what tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The code that was most challenging for me to write was writing global variables in Python. I am not certain why but declaring a global variable inside of a function would crash my program. I attempted to figure out why and was able to prevent the program crashing, but could not achieve the intended goal so I scrapped my original idea and chose to declare the global variable outside of the functions.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Working in multiple languages. This project has really helped me get a good grasp of how working in multiple languages is done and how the workflow should feel.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I think I did a good job documenting as much as possible without being redundant which helps maintainability and readability. When it comes to adaptability, I built the Python functions to be modular to allow for future functions to be built with the use of helper functions.
